The key integration with ArduPilot involves the ARSPD_TYPE parameter for sensor selection, ARSPD_RATIO for calibration, and EKF3 fusion parameters. Recent developments from 2020-2025 focus on self-diagnostic capabilities and multi-sensor redundancy.""")

MEMS sensors use microfabricated silicon structures to detect airflow through thermal or pressure changes. They're miniaturized, low-power, and cost-effective for basic airspeed measurement.

Multi-hole probes, based on my analysis of recent research, use multiple pressure ports (typically 3, 5, or 7) to measure complete 3D flow vectors including angle of attack and sideslip. They provide comprehensive flow data but require complex calibration procedures.

For UAV applications, MEMS sensors excel in array configurations and power-constrained systems, while multi-hole probes are preferred for research applications requiring full flow characterization.""")

2. Wiring issues - Check I2C/analog connections based on sensor type
3. Calibration problems - Use ARSPD_AUTOCAL for automatic calibration
4. EKF integration - Verify EK3_ARSP_THR threshold settings

Recent forum discussions and professional best practices emphasize the importance of proper pre-flight calibration and monitoring EKF innovations for sensor health.""")
