# Unknown-Unknown Discovery Loop: Scientific Methodology

## Abstract

This document presents the scientific methodology underlying the Unknown-Unknown Discovery Loop, a novel framework for systematic identification of epistemic gaps in domain-specific knowledge systems. Applied to UAV airflow sensing technologies, this methodology reveals previously hidden knowledge voids that represent breakthrough research opportunities.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Epistemic Landscape Theory

The Unknown-Unknown Discovery Loop is grounded in **dynamical systems theory** applied to knowledge spaces. We model knowledge domains as multi-dimensional epistemic landscapes where:

- **Knowledge potential φ(x)** represents information density at position x
- **Ignorance gradient ∇I(x) = -∇φ(x)** points toward maximum ignorance
- **Epistemic coordinates** map domain expertise to geometric space
- **Fixed points** represent stable knowledge/ignorance configurations
- **Bifurcations** indicate critical transitions between epistemic regimes

### 1.2 Mathematical Framework

#### Knowledge Potential Function
```
φ(x) = Σᵢ Aᵢ exp(-||x - cᵢ||²/σᵢ²)
```
Where:
- `x` = position in epistemic space
- `cᵢ` = knowledge center positions
- `Aᵢ` = knowledge density amplitudes
- `σᵢ` = knowledge spread parameters

#### Ignorance Flow Dynamics
```
dx/dt = -∇I(x) = ∇φ(x)
```
Particles in epistemic space flow from ignorance toward knowledge regions.

#### Entropy Evolution
```
S(t) = -Σᵢ pᵢ(t) log pᵢ(t)
```
Tracking knowledge distribution entropy over discovery iterations.

## 2. Competency Question Framework

### 2.1 Competency Questions (CQs)

Standard competency questions assess **known knowledge**:

1. "What are the primary sensing mechanisms in MEMS airflow sensors?"
2. "How do multi-hole probes calculate wind vector components?"
3. "What calibration procedures are required for pitot tubes in UAV applications?"
4. "How does sensor fusion integrate airflow data with IMU measurements?"
5. "What are the power consumption characteristics of thermal airflow sensors?"

### 2.2 Anti-Competency Questions (Anti-CQs)

Anti-competency questions probe **systematic ignorance**:

1. **Technological Unknown**: "What airflow sensing technologies exist beyond current MEMS, pitot, and multi-hole paradigms?"
2. **Fundamental Physics Unknown**: "How do quantum effects influence microscale airflow measurements?"
3. **Emergent Behavior Unknown**: "What are the undiscovered failure modes in UAV airflow sensor networks?"
4. **Environmental Unknown**: "How do atmospheric anomalies affect sensor accuracy in ways not yet characterized?"
5. **Theoretical Unknown**: "What mathematical frameworks exist for airflow sensor optimization that we haven't discovered?"

## 3. Discovery Loop Algorithm

### 3.1 Initialization Phase

```python
def initialize_epistemic_state(knowledge_base):
    coordinates = compute_knowledge_coordinates(knowledge_base)
    entropy = compute_knowledge_entropy(knowledge_base)
    competency = assess_competency_questions(knowledge_base)
    
    return EpistemicPoint(
        coordinates=coordinates,
        knowledge_state=KnowledgeState.KNOWN_KNOWN,
        entropy=entropy,
        competency_score=competency
    )
```

### 3.2 Exploration Phase

```python
def navigate_epistemic_landscape(current_state, anti_cqs):
    exploration_vectors = [normalize(anti_cq.exploration_vector) 
                          for anti_cq in anti_cqs]
    
    discovered_regions = []
    for vector in exploration_vectors:
        path = explore_direction(current_state, vector, steps=10)
        low_knowledge_regions = [point for point in path 
                               if point.knowledge_potential < threshold]
        discovered_regions.extend(low_knowledge_regions)
    
    return discovered_regions
```

### 3.3 Analysis Phase

```python
def analyze_epistemic_dynamics(trajectory):
    # Fixed point detection
    fixed_points = find_fixed_points(trajectory)
    
    # Bifurcation analysis
    bifurcations = detect_bifurcations(trajectory)
    
    # Convergence classification
    convergence_type = classify_convergence(trajectory)
    
    return {
        'fixed_points': fixed_points,
        'bifurcations': bifurcations,
        'convergence': convergence_type
    }
```

## 4. Network Topology Analysis

### 4.1 Ignorance Graph Construction

Epistemic voids are connected if their positions are within distance threshold δ:

```python
def build_ignorance_network(gaps, threshold=0.3):
    G = nx.Graph()
    
    for i, gap1 in enumerate(gaps):
        G.add_node(i, position=gap1.position, severity=gap1.severity)
        
        for j, gap2 in enumerate(gaps[i+1:], i+1):
            distance = np.linalg.norm(gap1.position - gap2.position)
            if distance < threshold:
                G.add_edge(i, j, distance=distance)
    
    return G
```

### 4.2 Topology Metrics

- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures local interconnectedness of ignorance regions
- **Connected Components**: Identifies isolated vs. connected knowledge voids  
- **Centrality Measures**: Ranks most critical gaps for breakthrough potential

## 5. Convergence Analysis

### 5.1 Convergence Types

The discovery loop exhibits five convergence behaviors:

1. **Fixed Point**: Stable ignorance configuration (displacement < 0.01, variance < 0.001)
2. **Periodic**: Oscillating knowledge states (0.01 < displacement < 0.1, variance > 0.01)
3. **Chaotic**: Unpredictable dynamics (0.1 < displacement < 0.5, variance > 0.1)
4. **Divergent**: Expanding exploration (displacement > 0.5)
5. **Marginal**: Boundary dynamics (intermediate values)

### 5.2 Entropy Dynamics

```python
def track_entropy_evolution(results):
    entropies = results['knowledge_entropy']
    
    if len(entropies) > 1:
        trend = 'increasing' if entropies[-1] > entropies[0] else 'decreasing'
    else:
        trend = 'stable'
    
    return {
        'final_entropy': entropies[-1],
        'trend': trend,
        'evolution': entropies
    }
```
